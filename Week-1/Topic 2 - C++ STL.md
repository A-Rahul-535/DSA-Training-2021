# C++ STL
C++ STL (Standard Template Library) is a powerful set of C++ template classes to provide general-purpose classes and functions with templates that implement many popular and commonly used algorithms and data structures like vectors (dynamic arrays), lists, queues, and stacks. Out of these vectors, maps and sets are the most commonly used containers.
